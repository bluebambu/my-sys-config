## zsh setup

**On macbook pro M1, antigen always has issue of oh-my-zsh related error. No color and suggestions after openning >3 terminals! So I found this is the most reliable way to intall them.**
1. zsh-autosuggest:  
   use the manual install method: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#manual-git-clone
2. syntax:  
   fast-syntax seems not work, I used the zsh-syntax-highlighting w/ brew install:  Mac OS X / Homebrew: brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
